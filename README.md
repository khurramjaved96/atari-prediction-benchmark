# Arcade prediction benchmark
For evaluating policy evaluation on Atari. The policies are taken from pre-trained rainbow DQN agent from the Chiner RL model zoo [1].

A small test policy for Pong with sample code is available in test.py. The full policies for all environments can be downloaded from [Google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zOWay0-9rGrmJMa9vP4qEwTjd-kziDTu/view?usp=sharing). Each environment contains over 100 million steps of interaction.
